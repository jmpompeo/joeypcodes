---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Setup must complete before foundational work.  
- **Phase 2 ‚Üí Phases 3‚Äì7**: Foundational assets (layouts, components, content stubs) are prerequisites for all user stories.  
- **User Story Order**: US1 (P1) ‚Üí US2 (P1) ‚Üí US3 (P2) ‚Üí US4 (P2) ‚Üí US5 (P3). Each story can begin once Phase 2 is complete and earlier-priority stories are delivered, but stories for the same priority may run in parallel if files do not conflict.  
- **Phase 8** begins after all targeted user stories are feature-complete.

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **US1**: After T027, T028‚ÄìT031 can be coded sequentially within `index.astro`, while T032 finalizes metadata.  
- **US2**: T033 (contact page) can proceed while T034 updates the footer, provided coordination on shared components.  
- **US4**: T040 (projects index) and T041 (detail route) can move in parallel once T039 updates content, as they affect separate files.  
- **US5**: T044‚ÄìT046 can be authored concurrently since each touches a separate markdown file; T047 and T048 can pair while T049 focuses on the dynamic route.

---

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP First**: Complete Phases 1‚Äì3 to deliver the home page experience (US1) as the minimum viable product.  
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Layer on US2 (contact) and US3‚ÄìUS5 in priority order, validating each route independently before proceeding.  
3. **Quality Gate**: Reserve Phase 8 for cross-cutting polish after all desired user stories are merged.  
4. **Collaboration**: Use [P]-marked tasks to parallelize work on distinct files without merge conflicts.
