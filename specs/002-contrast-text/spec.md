# Feature Specification: Contrast-Safe Themes

**Feature Branch**: `002-contrast-text`  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we need to make sure there is contrast between dark mode and light mode. on the dark background, the text needs to be light, and on the light background the text needs to be dark."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Readable Themes (Priority: P1)

As a visitor using either dark or light theme, I want text and interactive content to remain legible so I can consume the site without eye strain or missed information.

**Why this priority**: Poor contrast blocks visitors from using the site at all, directly hurting usability and accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Manually toggle between dark/light modes and run an accessibility contrast checker (e.g., WAVE, Axe) to confirm WCAG AA ratios are met for text and interactive elements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the dark theme is active, **When** I view body text, headings, links, and buttons, **Then** each foreground element has ≥ 4.5:1 contrast against its background (3:1 for text ≥ 18 pt or 14 pt bold).
2. **Given** the light theme is active, **When** I view the same surfaces, **Then** each foreground element meets the same WCAG AA contrast ratios against the light backgrounds.

### User Story 2 - Prevent Regressions (Priority: P2)

As a site maintainer, I want automated checks for color contrast so future visual tweaks keep both themes compliant.

**Why this priority**: Automated enforcement reduces the chance of accidental regressions during future styling updates.

**Independent Test**: Execute the CI job or npm script that runs contrast regression tests; the job passes only if all measured surfaces meet the documented contrast thresholds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request introduces styling changes, **When** the automated contrast audit runs, **Then** it flags any element whose contrast ratio drops below the minimum and fails the build until corrected.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a browser or OS-level theme toggle is flipped while a page is already open? All existing elements must restyle with compliant contrast immediately.
- How does the system handle third-party embeds (e.g., code snippets, iframes) that might not inherit theme tokens? Provide safe defaults or theme-aware wrappers to avoid unreadable sections.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The design system MUST define paired foreground/background tokens for dark and light themes that achieve WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (≥ 4.5:1 for body text, ≥ 3:1 for large text and UI icons).
- **FR-002**: Theme switching MUST update all site sections (global components, cards, buttons, navigation, footers, callouts) to use the correct contrast-safe tokens without page reload.
- **FR-003**: Error states, focus outlines, and hover states MUST maintain the same minimum contrast against their respective backgrounds in both themes.
- **FR-004**: Automated accessibility checks MUST run as part of the QA process or CI pipeline, failing if any audited element falls below the specified contrast ratios.
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST summarize the approved color token pairings and instruct contributors on how to select compliant combinations for new components.

### Key Entities

- **Theme Palette**: Conceptual map of light and dark surface/background tokens, text tokens, interactive states, and their required contrast ratios.
- **Audit Report**: Output from automated tooling (e.g., axe-core, Lighthouse) highlighting pass/fail status for contrast checks per component or page.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All sampled text and interactive elements in dark mode achieve ≥ 4.5:1 contrast for standard text and ≥ 3:1 for large text/UI affordances, as verified by accessibility tooling.
- **SC-002**: All sampled text and interactive elements in light mode achieve the same contrast thresholds, verified by the same audit.
- **SC-003**: Automated contrast checks run on every PR to `main`, and zero PRs merge with failing contrast audits over a rolling 30-day period.
- **SC-004**: Post-launch accessibility review confirms that at least 95% of surveyed users rate theme readability as “good” or higher in qualitative feedback.

## Assumptions

- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios are the governing standard for this initiative.
- Existing brand colors may be adjusted within acceptable brand guidelines to meet contrast needs.
- The current theme toggle component already exists; enhancements focus on color tokens and audits rather than building a new toggle control.
