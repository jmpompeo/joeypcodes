## Why Azure Functions?

Azure Functions offer a fast path to serverless automation, but scaling them responsibly takes a plan. In this guide, I share the strategies that kept response times predictable as workloads spiked.

## Durable and Stateless Functions Together

- Offload stateful orchestration with Durable Functions while keeping high-throughput work in stateless functions.
- Use fan-out/fan-in patterns for batch workloads and ensure the orchestrator tracks checkpoints.

## Tuning Throughput

1. Configure concurrency limits and queue length thresholds based on empirical traffic data.
2. Cache configuration and secrets in-memory to minimize cold start overhead.
3. Benchmark regularly and capture traces to identify bottlenecks early.

## Observability Must-Haves

- Add structured logging with correlation IDs to trace jobs end to end.
- Enable Application Insights for request telemetry and dependency tracking.
- Schedule load tests and compare results over time to detect regressions.

## Next Steps

Export these patterns into reusable templates so every new automation function starts with a proven foundation.
