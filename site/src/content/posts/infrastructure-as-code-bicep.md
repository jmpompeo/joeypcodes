## Why Bicep

Bicep gives Azure teams expressive templates without sacrificing type safety. These are the patterns that kept enterprise deployments predictable across dozens of subscriptions.

## Modular Design

- Compose reusable modules with clear parameters and outputs.
- Version modules through artifact feeds so updates are traceable.
- Document expected usage with examples and companion diagrams.

## Guardrails

Add Azure Policy assignments and role definitions as part of the deployment. Guardrails belong in code, not runbooks.

## Deployment Workflow

1. Validate templates locally using `bicep build` and `what-if`.
2. Use GitHub Actions to lint, test, and publish modules.
3. Promote modules through ring-based environments with approvals.

## Closing Thoughts

Treat infrastructure as a product: iterate, measure, and bake observability into every template.
