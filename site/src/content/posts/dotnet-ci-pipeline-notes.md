## Foundation First

Start with a pipeline template that captures your organization standards: linting, unit tests, security scans, and deployment gates.

## Key Enhancements

- **Parallel test partitions:** run unit, integration, and contract tests concurrently to shorten feedback loops.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** use Bicep or Terraform modules in the pipeline for consistent environments.
- **Secret rotation:** integrate Azure Key Vault and schedule semi-automated rotations.

## Fast Failures

Use required checks on pull requests and surface actionable diagnostics in GitHub annotations.

## Deployment Quality Gates

1. Run smoke tests post-deploy using Playwright.
2. Capture post-deployment metrics and block rollouts if error budgets shrink.
3. Notify the team with a summary digest that includes coverage, performance, and known issues.

## Wrapping Up

Reliable pipelines are living systemsâ€”keep iterating as your platform evolves.
